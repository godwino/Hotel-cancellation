## Project Overview

The Hotel Cancellation Prediction Project is a machine learning initiative designed to predict the likelihood of hotel booking cancellations. The project's predictive model processes historical booking data to help hotels minimize revenue loss from last-minute cancellations and optimize their booking strategies.

### Objectives

- Create a reliable predictive model with high accuracy for cancellation predictions.
- Analyze the impact of various factors (e.g., booking lead time, deposit type) on cancellation probabilities.
- Provide a tool for hotels to enhance their booking systems with predictive analytics.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning tools.
- A trained machine learning model capable of predicting booking cancellations with high accuracy.
- A web-based interface to input new booking data and receive predictions.
- Comprehensive documentation on model development and evaluation.

## Installation

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hotel-predict/hotel-cancellation-prediction.git
cd hotel-cancellation-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
pip 19.0+
An internet connection to download the necessary Python packages.

python predict.py --input data/INNHotelsGroup (2).csv
Data
The project uses a dataset containing features like booking dates, customer details, room preferences, special requests, and historical cancellation data.

Source
The data is derived from the "Hotel Booking Demand" dataset, which is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is performed by:

python scripts/preprocess.py --input data/raw_bookings.csv --output data/processed_bookings.csv
Model
The project uses a Random Forest classifier, chosen for its balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Training
Train the model with:
python scripts/train.py --data data/processed_bookings.csv

Certainly! Below is a sample README for a fictional hotel cancellation prediction project. This README assumes the project uses a machine learning model to predict cancellations based on historical booking data.

An internet connection to download the necessary Python packages.
Usage
To make predictions with the model:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input data/new_bookings.csv
This will output a prediction for each booking in new_bookings.csv.

Data
The project uses a dataset containing features like booking dates, customer details, room preferences, special requests, and historical cancellation data.

Source
The data is derived from the "Hotel Booking Demand" dataset, which is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Training
Train the model with:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train.py --data data/processed_bookings.csv
Performance
The model achieves the following performance on a held-out test set:

Accuracy: 87%
Precision: 82%
Recall: 79%
F1 Score: 80.5%
Detailed performance metrics can be found in the evaluation/ directory.
