I conducted a comprehensive data analysis of FIFA World
Cup tournaments to evaluate the team, by using the goals scored
during each world cup, the top performing countries vs least
performing countries. Using the data to determine how many times a
specific country has won the FIFA World Cup. Performed exploratory
data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the
data. Applied machine learning algorithms to predict match outcomes
and identify influential factors such as possession, shots on goal, and
team formations.
